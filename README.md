ECS-60: Data Structures and Programming
======
Weeder course of CS. Taken Fall 2013.

Design and analysis of data structures for a variety of applications. Trees, heaps, searching, sorting, hashing, graphs. Extensive programming.

There are 2 programs that are not included. This is due to the fact that I don't know what happened to them. Probably lost them when I reformatted my computer and forgot to back them up.

The fourth program had us utilize different data structures to program a time efficient song database in which the user can search and buy songs. The database accounts for inventory, so it was possible the user could "buy" a song that was out of stock, but the program would notify them about it.

The last program was implementing Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for a given "teacher generated" map file.
